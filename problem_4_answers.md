1. The <code> d3.selectAll('tbody tr')[0].length -1 </code> looks at the table body and returns the number of rows in this table. We look at the 0th column and return the number of rows in this table.

2. Color(0) returns very bright orange. Color(10) returns lighter, but still very bright orange. And color(50) returns bright light blue color.

3. We know have that the minimum rate is 0 and the maximum rate is 50. Thus we have it so a color of 0 corresponds to the one end of the spectrum, in this case orange, and color(50) will correspond to silver. As we move outside this domain we move across ranges, so that color(150) displays a bright light blue.
