1. The <code>colspan</code> attribute of the <code> th </code> node determines how many columns the table header should span. In this case we have 3 columns and so we mark that the table header will go across all 3 of these columns. If we reduce the colspan argument to just 1, the header will appear only on top of the first header, but not the rest.

3. The DOM inspector will highlight the regions that are in questions as you browse overthem. Furthermore we can edit the html/javascript/CSS and note the changes it makes to the webpage. For example I can change the colspan variable described above and note the changes as the webpage is re-rendered. However the entire HTML page source is useful as we can see the structure more clearly in its entirity. The HTML source code is usually better organized than the DOM in terms of being easier to read, and easier to see entire blocks that are seperated off from each other
